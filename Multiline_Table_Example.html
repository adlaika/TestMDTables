<p>Multiline tables allow headers and table rows to span multiple lines of text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of the table are not supported).</p>
<p>These work like simple tables, but with the following differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must begin with a row of dashes, before the header text (unless the headers are omitted).</li>
<li>They must end with a row of dashes, then a blank line.</li>
<li>The rows must be separated by blank lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>In multiline tables, the table parser pays attention to the widths of the columns, and the writers try to reproduce these relative widths in the output. So, if you find that one of the columns is too narrow in the output, try widening it in the Markdown source.</p>
